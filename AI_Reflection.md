## AI Collaboration Notes

- AI assistant reviewed `backend/pyproject.toml`, configured linting/formatting/testing tools (pytest, coverage, black, isort, ruff), and reviewed the structure to stay aligned with FastAPI best practices.
- AI assistant drafted the project README (root pointer + `backend/README.md`) explaining setup, tooling, and usage.
- AI assistant created backend-specific `.gitignore` entries to avoid committing virtualenvs, caches, coverage outputs, etc.
- AI assistant built the Mermaid ER diagram + supporting notes in `docs/domain-model.md` so the schema stays understandable.
